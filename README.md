# Case-Study--Cyclistic-Trip-Data-Analysis

This analysis is based on the Divvy case study "'Sophisticated, Clear, and Polished’: Divvy
and Data Visualization" written by Kevin Hartman (found here:
https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study). The purpose of this script is to
consolidate downloaded Divvy data into a single dataframe and then conduct simple analysis to
help answer the key question: “How do annual members and casual riders use Divvy bikes
differently?

(Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study,
the datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by
Motivate International Inc. under this license: https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)

This Case Study has been done as part of the Google Data Analytics Certification.
