# Case-Study---Data-Analytics-Course

This analysis is based on the Divvy case study "'Sophisticated, Clear, and Polished’: Divvy
and Data Visualization" written by Kevin Hartman (found here:
https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study). The purpose of this script is to
consolidate downloaded Divvy data into a single dataframe and then conduct simple analysis to
help answer the key question: “How do annual members and casual riders use Divvy bikes
differently?

This Case Study is being done as part of the Google Data Analytics Certification.
